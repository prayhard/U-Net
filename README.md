### Put UNet.ipynb in the directory at the same level as archive to avoid errors in reading files, or modify the path to which you read files to avoid errors.

* Use python3.8.20 or later

* Make sure the required third library is installed

* Just run the code in the order of the code boxes in ipynb

* Because it takes more time to train the model, you can choose to directly look at the prediction section, and submit the model file with the training completed
